        "answer": 100,
        "generated": [
            "Answer: First, let's find the weight of 3 cakes. Since 4 cakes weigh 800 g, one cake weighs 800 / 4 = 200 g. So, 3 cakes weigh 3 * 200 = 600 g.\n\nNow, let's convert 1 kg 100 g to grams. 1 kg = 1000 g, so 1 kg 100 g = 1100 g.\n\nThe total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread is 1100 g. Subtract the weight of the 3 cakes: 1100 - 600 = 500 g.\n\nNow, we know that 5 pieces of bread weigh 500 g. So, one piece of bread weighs 500 / 5 = 100 g.\n\nFinally, let's find the difference in weight between a cake and a piece of bread: 200 g (cake) - 100 g (bread) = 100 g.\n\nAnswer: A cake is 100 g heavier than a piece of bread. ans = 100"

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 2M = 22. Dividing both sides by 2, we get M = 11.\n\nNow we can find the amount of money Tara has: T = M + 4 = 11 + 4 = 15.\n\nSo, Tara has $15.\nans = 15"

            "Answer: In an isosceles triangle, two angles are equal (base angles), and the third angle is different. The sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Given one angle is 54 degrees, we need to find the base angles.\n\nLet the base angles be x degrees each. Since there are two base angles, the sum of the base angles is 2x. Now, we can set up an equation:\n\n54 + 2x = 180\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n2x = 180 - 54\n2x = 126\nx = 63\n\nSo, the base angles of the triangle are 63 degrees each.\nans = 63"

        "answer": 45,
        "generated": [
            "Answer: Let's denote the base angles as x and the vertex angle as y. Since the vertex angle is twice either base angle, we have y = 2x. In an isosceles triangle, the sum of all angles is 180 degrees. So, x + x + y = 180. \n\nNow, we can substitute y with 2x: x + x + 2x = 180. This simplifies to 4x = 180. To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 4: x = 45. \n\nNow we can find the vertex angle y: y = 2x = 2 * 45 = 90. \n\nSo, the angles of the triangle are 45, 45, and 90 degrees.\nans = 45, 45, 90"

They meet in 7 hours, so the distance covered is 70 km.\nSo, 7(y - x) = 70  (1)\n\nWhen they travel towards each other, the relative speed is (x + y) km/h. They meet in 1 hour, so the distance covered is 70 km.\nSo, (x + y) = 70  (2)\n\nNow, we can solve the two equations simultaneously:\n\nFrom equation (2), y = 70 - x\nSubstitute this into equation (1):\n7((70 - x) - x) = 70\n7(70 - 2x) = 70\n490 - 14x = 70\n14x = 420\nx = 30\n\nNow, substitute x back into equation (2) to find y:\ny = 70 - 30\ny = 40\n\nSo, the speed of the car starting from A is 30 km/h and the speed of the car starting from B is 40 km/h.\nans = 30, 40"

The area of the second lawn is 60 * 60 = 3600 square meters.\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the areas of the two lawns. The ratio is 3600 / 900 = 4.

            "Answer: The ratio of regular milk to chocolate milk is 7:2. Since 49 cartons of regular milk were sold, we can find the number of units in the ratio by dividing 49 by 7, which is 7 units. So, 1 unit represents 7 cartons of milk. For chocolate milk, there are 2 units in the ratio, so 2 units * 7 cartons/unit = 14 cartons of chocolate milk were sold.
