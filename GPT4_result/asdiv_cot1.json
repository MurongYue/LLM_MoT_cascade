            "Answer: Let's denote the number of large groups as L and the number of small groups as S. We know that 7L + 3S = 90. To minimize the number of groups, we need to maximize the number of large groups. \n\nDividing 90 by 7, we get 12 with a remainder of 6. So, there can be 12 large groups with 7 members each, which accounts for 84 members. The remaining 6 members can form 2 small groups of 3 members each. \n\nTherefore, the ballet class should make 12 large groups to minimize the number of groups.\nans = 12",

We know that 7L + 3S = 90 and we want to minimize the total number of groups, which is L + S.\n\nTo minimize the number of groups, we should maximize the number of large groups. So, we can start by finding the largest multiple of 7 that is less than or equal to 90. The largest multiple of 7 less than or equal to 90 is 84 (7 * 12). Therefore, we can have 12 large groups.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of small groups. Since 7 * 12 = 84, we have 90 - 84 = 6 members left.

            "Answer: First, we need to find the total weight of 5 bags of chips and the total weight of 4 bottles of juice.\n\nSince 2 bags of chips weigh 800 g, 5 bags of chips weigh 5 * (800 g / 2) = 2000 g.\n\nThe total weight of 5 bags of chips and 4 bottles of juice is 2 kg 200 g, which is equal to 2200 g.\n\nNow, we can find the total weight of 4 bottles of juice by subtracting the total weight of 5 bags of chips from the total weight: 2200 g - 2000 g = 200 g.\n\nSince there are 4 bottles of juice, the weight of 1 bottle of juice is 200 g / 4 = 50 g.\n\nNow, to find how much heavier a bag of chips is than a bottle of juice, we can subtract the weight of a bottle of juice from the weight of a bag of chips: (800 g / 2) - 50 g = 400 g - 50 g = 350 g.\n\nSo, a bag of chips is 350 g heavier than a bottle of juice.\n\nans = 350",

        "answer": 10,
        "generated": [
            "Answer: Let's first find the weight of one diamond. Since 5 diamonds weigh 100 g, one diamond weighs 100 / 5 = 20 g.\n\nNow, let's find the total weight of the 4 diamonds in the second scenario. Since one diamond weighs 20 g, the 4 diamonds weigh 4 * 20 = 80 g.\n\nSince the total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g, the combined weight of the 2 jades is 140 - 80 = 60 g.\n\nNow, let's find the weight of one jade. Since 2 jades weigh 60 g, one jade weighs 60 / 2 = 30 g.\n\nFinally, let's find the difference in weight between a jade and a diamond. Since one jade weighs 30 g and one diamond weighs 20 g, a jade is 30 - 20 = 10 g heavier than a diamond.\n\nans = 10",
            "Answer: Let's denote the weight of a diamond as D and the weight of a jade as J. We have the following equations:\n\n5D = 100\n4D + 2J = 140\n\nFrom the first equation, we find the weight of a diamond: D = 100/5 = 20 g.\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of D in the second equation:\n\n4(20) + 2J = 140\n80 + 2J = 140\n2J = 60\nJ = 30\n\nSo, the weight of a jade is 30 g. To find the difference in weight between a jade and a diamond, we subtract the weight of a diamond from the weight of a jade:\n\n30 - 20 = 10\n\nAnswer: A jade is 10 g heavier than a diamond. ans = 10",
            "Answer: Let's denote the weight of a diamond as D and the weight of a jade as J.\n\nWe know that the weight of 5 diamonds is 100 g, so 5D = 100 g. From this, we can find the weight of one diamond: D = 100/5 = 20 g.\n\nWe also know that the total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g, so 4D + 2J = 140 g. We can substitute the value of D we found earlier: 4(20) + 2J = 140 g, which simplifies to 80 + 2J = 140 g.\n\nNow, we can solve for the weight of one jade: 2J = 140 - 80 = 60 g, so J = 60/2 = 30 g.\n\nTo find how much heavier a jade is than a diamond, we subtract the weight of a diamond from the weight of a jade: 30 - 20 = 10 g.\n\nSo, a jade is 10 g heavier than a diamond.\nans = 10"

        "answer": 10,
        "generated": [
            "Answer: Let's denote the weight of a single bed as S and the weight of a double bed as D. We know that 5 single beds weigh 50 kg, so 5S = 50. From this, we can determine that S = 10 kg.\n\nNow, we know that the total weight of 2 single beds and 4 double beds is 100 kg. So, 2S + 4D = 100. We can substitute the value of S (10 kg) into this equation: 2(10) + 4D = 100. This simplifies to 20 + 4D = 100. Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get 4D = 80. Dividing by 4, we find that D = 20 kg.\n\nThus, a double bed weighs 20 kg, and a single bed weighs 10 kg. To find the difference in weight, we subtract the weight of a single bed from the weight of a double bed: 20 - 10 = 10 kg.\n\nSo, a double bed is 10 kg heavier than a single bed. \nans = 10",
            "Answer: Let's first find the weight of 2 single beds: 5 single beds weigh 50 kg, so 1 single bed weighs 50/5 = 10 kg. Therefore, 2 single beds weigh 2 * 10 = 20 kg.\n\nNow, we know that the total weight of 2 single beds and 4 double beds is 100 kg. Subtract the weight of the 2 single beds from the total weight: 100 - 20 = 80 kg. This means that the 4 double beds weigh 80 kg in total.\n\nNext, find the weight of 1 double bed: 80 kg / 4 = 20 kg.\n\nNow, we can find how much heavier a double bed is than a single bed: 20 kg (double bed) - 10 kg (single bed) = 10 kg.\n\nans = 10",
            "Answer: Let the weight of a single bed be S kg and the weight of a double bed be D kg.\nWe know that 5 single beds weigh 50 kg, so 5S = 50.

            "Answer: First, let's find the weight of 3 cakes. Since 4 cakes weigh 800 g, then 1 cake weighs 800 g / 4 = 200 g.

Since 4 cakes weigh 800 g, then 1 cake weighs 800 g / 4 = 200 g.\nSo, 3 cakes weigh 3 * 200 g = 600 g.\n\nNow, let's convert 1 kg 100 g to grams. 1 kg = 1000 g, so 1 kg 100 g = 1100 g.\n\nThe total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread is 1100 g. Subtracting the weight of the 3 cakes, we get the total weight of the 5 pieces of bread: 1100 g - 600 g = 500 g.\n\nNow, let's find the weight of 1 piece of bread: 500 g / 5 = 100 g.\n\nFinally, let's find the difference in weight between a cake and a piece of bread: 200 g (cake) - 100 g (bread) = 100 g.\n\nSo, a cake is 100 g heavier than a piece of bread.\nans = 100",

Let's denote their weights as R, P, and S for Rita, Peter, and Skeeter, respectively.\n\nWe know that R + P + S = 90 and P + S = 68. Since Rita and Peter weigh the same amount, we can say R = P.\n\nNow we can substitute R with P in the first equation: P + P + S = 90, which simplifies to 2P + S = 90.\n\nWe already know that P + S = 68, so we can subtract this equation from the previous one: (2P + S) - (P + S) = 90 - 68, which simplifies to P = 22.\n\nNow we can find Skeeter's weight by substituting P back into the equation P + S = 68: 22 + S = 68.

So, 2x (Rita and Peter's combined weight) + Skeeter's weight = 90.\n\nSince Peter and Skeeter weigh 68 pounds together, we can represent Skeeter's weight as (68 - x). Now we can set up the equation:\n\n2x + (68 - x) = 90\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx + 68 = 90\nx = 22\n\nSince x represents Rita and Peter's weight, and they both weigh the same, Skeeter's weight is 68 - 22 = 46 pounds.\nans = 46"

            "Answer: Mila's father gets a total of $3,875 per week from both jobs. Let's denote the pay from the 2nd job as x. The pay from the 1st job is x + $375. The total pay from both jobs is x + (x + $375) = $3,875.\n\nSo, 2x + $375 = $3,875. To find the value of x, we can subtract $375 from both sides of the equation:\n\n2x = $3,500\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 2 to find the value of x:\n\nx = $1,750\n\nNow we know that the pay from the 2nd job is $1,750. To find the pay from the 1st job, we can add $375 to the pay from the 2nd job:\n\nPay from the 1st job = $1,750 + $375 = $2,125\n\nans = 2125",

Divide both sides by 2: x = $1,750.\nNow, we know the 2nd job's pay is $1,750, so the 1st job's pay is $1,750 + $375 = $2,125.\nans = 2125",

            "Answer: Let's assume Teddy's age is x and Tony's age is x - 2 (since Tony is 2 years younger than Teddy). Their mother's age is 42.\nSo, x + (x - 2) = 42\nCombining the terms, we get 2x - 2 = 42\nAdding 2 to both sides, we get 2x = 44\nDividing by 2, we get x = 22\nSo, Teddy's age is 22, and Tony's age is 22 - 2 = 20.\nans = Tony: 20, Teddy: 22",
            "Answer: Let's denote Teddy's age as T and Tony's age as t. We know that Tony is 2 years younger than Teddy, so t = T - 2. We also know that the sum of their ages equals their mother's age, which is 42. So, T + t = 42.\n\nNow, we can substitute the equation for Tony's age into the equation for their mother's age: T + (T - 2) = 42.\n\nCombining the terms, we get 2T - 2 = 42. Adding 2 to both sides, we get 2T = 44. Dividing by 2, we find that T = 22. Now we know that Teddy is 22 years old.\n\nTo find Tony's age, we can use the equation t = T - 2. So, t = 22 - 2 = 20.

            "Answer: To find the perimeter of the field, we need to add the lengths of all the sides. Since the width of the rectangle and the side of the triangle measure the same, the width of the rectangle is also 42 ft. The perimeter of the rectangle is 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (76 + 42) = 2 * 118 = 236 ft.\n\nNow, we need to find the perimeter of the equilateral triangle. Since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal, the perimeter of the triangle is 3 * side = 3 * 42 = 126 ft.\n\nFinally, we need to subtract the width of the rectangle (42 ft) from the total perimeter since it is shared by both the rectangle and the triangle. The perimeter of the field is the sum of the perimeters of the rectangle and the triangle minus the shared width: 236 + 126 - 42 = 320 ft.\n\nans = 320",

D - C = 30 (The ages of Cathy and Denver differ by 30 years)\n\nNow let's use these equations to find the ages of Anna and Ben.\n\nFrom equation 2 we can write D as D = 2A. \nFrom equation 4 we can write D as D = C + 30.\n\nSince both expressions represent D we can equate them: 2A = C + 30.\n\nFrom equation 3 we can write C as C = B/2.\n\nNow substitute the value of C in the equation 2A = C + 30: 2A = (B/2) + 30.\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables A and B:\n\n1. B - A = 3\n2. 2A = (B/2) + 30\n\nLet's solve these equations simultaneously.\n\nFrom equation 1 we can write B as B = A + 3.\n\nNow substitute the value of B in the equation 2A = (B/2) + 30: 2A = ((A + 3)/2) + 30.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 4A = A + 3 + 60.\n\nSimplify the equation: 3A = 63.\n\nNow divide both sides by 3: A = 21.\n\nNow that we have the value of A we can find the value of B using the equation B = A + 3: B = 21 + 3 = 24.\n\nSo the ages of Anna and Ben are 21 and 24 respectively."

            "Let the original speed of the man be x km/hr and the distance covered be d km.\n\nAccording to the first condition, if he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hour less. So, we can write the equation as:\nd/(x + 1/2) = d/x - 1\n\nAccording to the second condition, if he walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 more hours. So, we can write the equation as:\nd/(x - 1) = d/x + 3\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables, d and x:\n1) d/(x + 1/2) = d/x - 1\n2) d/(x - 1) = d/x + 3\n\nLet's solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of d and x.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate d from both equations by multiplying equation 1 by (x - 1) and equation 2 by (x + 1/2):\n\n1) d(x - 1) = d(x + 1/2)(x - 1) - (x - 1)\n2) d(x + 1/2) = d(x - 1)(x + 1/2) + 3(x + 1/2)\n\nNow, subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\nd(x + 1/2)(x - 1) - d(x - 1) = d(x - 1)(x + 1/2) + 3(x + 1/2) - d(x + 1/2)(x - 1) + (x - 1)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n2(x - 1) = 3(x + 1/2)\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n2x - 2 = 3x + 3/2\n2 = x + 3/2\nx = 1/2\n\nNow that we have the value of x, let's substitute it back into either equation 1 or 2 to find the value of d. Let's use equation 1:\n\nd/(1/2 + 1/2) = d/1 - 1\nd = d - 1\nd = 1\n\nSo, the distance covered by the man is 1 km, and his original rate of walking is 1/2 km/hr.",
            "Let the original speed be x km/hr and the distance be d km.\n\nThe time taken to cover the distance with the original speed is d/x hours.\n\nWhen he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, his speed becomes (x + 1/2) km/hr, and the time taken is d/(x + 1/2) hours. This time is 1 hour less than the original time, so we have:\n\nd/x - d/(x + 1/2) = 1\n\nWhen he walks 1 km/hr slower, his speed becomes (x - 1) km/hr, and the time taken is d/(x - 1) hours. This time is 3 hours more than the original time, so we have:\n\nd/(x - 1) - d/x = 3\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1) d/x - d/(x + 1/2) = 1\n2) d/(x - 1) - d/x = 3\n\nTo solve this system of equations, we can first find a common denominator for each equation:\n\n1) 2d/(2x) - 2d/(2x + 1) = 1\n2) d(x) - d(x - 1) = 3x(x - 1)\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of equation 1 by (2x)(2x + 1) and both sides of equation 2 by x(x - 1):\n\n1) 2d(2x + 1) - 2d(2x) = (2x)(2x + 1)\n2) d(x)(x - 1) - d(x - 1)(x) = 3x^2(x - 1)\n\nSimplify the equations:\n\n1) 4dx + 2d - 4d^2 = 4x^2 + 2x\n2) d(x^2 - x) - d(x^2 - x) = 3x^3 - 3x^2\n\nNow, we can solve equation 1 for d:\n\n4dx + 2d - 4d^2 = 4x^2 + 2x\n2d(2x + 1) = 4x^2 + 2x\nd = (4x^2 + 2x) / (2x + 1)\n\nSubstitute this expression for d into equation 2:\n\n((4x^2 + 2x) / (2x + 1))(x^2 - x) - ((4x^2 + 2x) / (2x + 1))(x^2 - x) = 3x^3 - 3x^2\n\nSince both sides of the equation are equal, we can conclude that the distance d and the original speed x are consistent with the given conditions.

So, the length of the journey is (x - 6) * (t + 12).\n\nSince all three expressions represent the same length of the journey, we can write two equations:\n\n1) x * t = (x + 6) * (t - 8)\n2) x * t = (x - 6) * (t + 12)\n\nNow we have a system of equations.

Since they are supplementary angles, their sum is 180 degrees.\nSo, x + (x + 18) = 180\n2x + 18 = 180\n2x = 162\nx = 81\nThe smaller angle is 81 degrees, and the larger angle is 81 + 18 = 99 degrees.\nans = 81, 99"

            "Answer: The distance around the rectangular garden is 36 feet, which is the perimeter. One side measures 10 feet. Let the other side be x feet. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.\n\nSo, 36 = 2(10 + x)\n36 = 20 + 2x\n16 = 2x\nx = 8\n\nNow we know the other side is 8 feet.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length (height), and W is the width.\n\nWe know the perimeter (P) is 20 inches and the width (W) is 6 inches.

            "Answer: To find out how many Atomic Fireballs Barbara has left, we need to know how many packages she bought. Since each package contains 9 Atomic Fireballs, we can divide the total number of Atomic Fireballs she ate (59) by the number of Atomic Fireballs in each package (9).\n\n59 / 9 = 6 packages with a remainder of 5 Atomic Fireballs.\n\nSo, Barbara bought 6 packages of Atomic Fireballs, which means she had 6 * 9 = 54 Atomic Fireballs in total. Since she ate 59 Atomic Fireballs, she must have had some extra ones before.\n\nTherefore, Barbara has 54 - 59 = -5 Atomic Fireballs left. However, since she cannot have negative Atomic Fireballs, it means she had 5 extra Atomic Fireballs before eating the ones from the packages. So, she has 0 Atomic Fireballs left after eating all the ones from the packages and the extra ones. \n\nans = 0",

Since there are 9 Atomic Fireballs in each package, she opened 59 / 9 = 6.56 packages. Since she can't open a partial package, she opened 7 packages in total.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of Atomic Fireballs from the 7 packages: 7 * 9 = 63 Atomic Fireballs.\n\nFinally, subtract the number of Atomic Fireballs she ate from the total number: 63 - 59 = 4 Atomic Fireballs.\n\nans = 4",
