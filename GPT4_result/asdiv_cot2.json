If x = 3, then 9 + 2y = 26, which gives y = 8.5 (not possible)\n4. If x = 4, then 12 + 2y = 26, which gives y = 7 (possible)\n5. If x = 5, then 15 + 2y = 26, which gives y = 5.5 (not possible)\n6.

The total weight of 4 pineapples is 1 kg 800 g, so the weight of one pineapple is (1 kg 800 g) / 4 = 450 g.\n\nFinally, to find how much heavier a watermelon is than a pineapple, we subtract the weight of a pineapple from the weight of a watermelon: 1 kg 300 g - 450 g = 850 g.\n\nSo, a watermelon is 850 g heavier than a pineapple.\nans = 850",

            "Answer: The worm climbs up 8 inches and slides back 3 inches every day, so it effectively climbs 8 - 3 = 5 inches per day. Since the hole is 26 inches deep, the worm needs to cover 26 - 8 = 18 inches more after the first day. \n\nSo, it will take 18 / 5 = 3.6 days to cover the remaining distance. Since the worm can't take a fraction of a day, it will take 4 more days to reach the top.\n\nIn total, it will take 1 (first day) + 4 (remaining days) = 5 days for the worm to reach the top.\nans = 5",

Since the hole is 26 inches deep, the worm needs to cover 21 inches (26 - 5) in the first few days. \n\n21 inches / 5 inches per day = 4.2 days. Since the worm cannot take a fraction of a day, it will take 5 full days to cover the 21 inches.

Since the worm can only count full days, it will take 4 more days to climb the remaining 18 inches. \n\nSo, it will take the worm 1 (first day) + 4 (remaining days) = 5 days to reach the top.\nans = 5"

            "Answer: Since Gina filled up one third of the container with red paint, the remaining two thirds were filled with blue paint. Since the blue paint is 4 L, each third of the container is equal to 2 L (4 L / 2 = 2 L). So, the total capacity of the container is 3 times 2 L, which is 6 L (3 * 2 L = 6 L).

Since the width of the rectangle and the side of the triangle are the same, we can use the given measurements to find the perimeter.\n\nThe rectangle has a length of 76 ft and a width of 42 ft. The two sides of the rectangle are the length (76 ft) and the width (42 ft).\n\nThe equilateral triangle has 3 sides, each measuring 42 ft.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the field is the sum of these sides: 76 + 42 + 42 + 42 = 202 ft.\n\nans = 202",
            "Answer: The perimeter of the field is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. The rectangular region has a length of 76 ft and a width of 42 ft. The equilateral triangle has 3 sides, each measuring 42 ft. Since the width of the rectangle and one side of the triangle are the same, we can consider them as one continuous side.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the field is the sum of the length of the rectangle, the width of the rectangle, and the remaining 2 sides of the triangle:\n\nPerimeter = Length of rectangle + Width of rectangle + 2 * Side of triangle\nPerimeter = 76 + 42 + 2 * 42\nPerimeter = 76 + 42 + 84\nPerimeter = 202 ft\n\nans = 202",
            "Answer: To find the perimeter of the field, we need to add the lengths of all the sides. The rectangular region has a length of 76 ft and a width of 42 ft. The equilateral triangle has three sides, each measuring 42 ft.\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (76 + 42) = 2 * 118 = 236 ft. However, since the triangle is attached to the width of the rectangle, we need to subtract one width (42 ft) from the perimeter.\n\nSo, the adjusted perimeter of the rectangle is 236 - 42 = 194 ft.\n\nNow, we need to add the perimeter of the equilateral triangle. Since all three sides are equal, the perimeter of the triangle is 3 * 42 = 126 ft.\n\nFinally, add the adjusted perimeter of the rectangle and the perimeter of the triangle to get the total perimeter of the field: 194 + 126 = 320 ft.\n\nans = 320"

D is twice as old as A: d = 2a\n3. B is twice as old as C: b = 2c\n4. The ages of D and C differ by 40 years: d - c = 40\n\nNow let's solve the equations:\n\nFrom equation 1, we can write a in terms of b: a = b + 2\nFrom equation 3, we can write c in terms of b: c = b/2\n\nNow, let's substitute the values of a and c in equation 4:\n\nd - c = 40\n2a - b/2 = 40 (since d = 2a and c = b/2)\n\nNow, substitute the value of a from equation 1:\n\n2(b + 2) - b/2 = 40\n2b + 4 - b/2 = 40\n\nMultiply the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n4b + 8 - b = 80\n3b = 72\nb = 24\n\nNow, we can find the age of A using equation 1:\n\na = b + 2\na = 24 + 2\na = 26\n\nSo, the ages of A and B are 26 and 24, respectively.",

So, x = (y + 6)(t - 8).\n\nAccording to the second condition, the distance covered at (y - 6) km/hr would take (t + 12) hours. So, x = (y - 6)(t + 12).\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1) x = (y + 6)(t - 8)\n2) x = (y - 6)(t + 12)\n\nSince both expressions equal x, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n(y + 6)(t - 8) = (y - 6)(t + 12)\n\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\nyt - 8y + 6t - 48 = yt + 12y + 6t - 72\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation by canceling out the common terms:\n\n-8y + 6t - 48 = 12y + 6t - 72\n\nNow, let's move all the terms to one side:\n\n20y = 24\n\nDivide both sides by 20:\n\ny = 1.2\n\nNow, let's plug the value of y into the first equation:\n\nx = (1.2 + 6)(t - 8)\n\nx = 7.2(t - 8)\n\nNow, let's plug the value of y into the second equation:\n\nx = (1.2 - 6)(t + 12)\n\nx = -4.8(t + 12)\n\nSince both expressions equal x, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n7.2(t - 8) = -4.8(t + 12)\n\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\n7.2t - 57.6 = -4.8t - 57.6\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation by canceling out the common terms:\n\n7.2t = -4.8t\n\nNow, let's move all the terms to one side:\n\n12t = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 12:\n\nt = 0\n\nHowever, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as the scheduled time cannot be 0.

Then, the length of the journey is S * T km.\n\nIf the train were 6 km/hr faster, its speed would be (S + 6) km/hr, and it would take (T - 8) hours to cover the same distance. So, (S + 6) * (T - 8) = S * T.\n\nIf the train were 6 km/hr slower, its speed would be (S - 6) km/hr, and it would take (T + 12) hours to cover the same distance. So, (S - 6) * (T + 12) = S * T.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) (S + 6) * (T - 8) = S * T\n2) (S - 6) * (T + 12) = S * T\n\nExpanding the equations:\n\n1) ST - 8S + 6T - 48 = ST\n2) ST + 12S - 6T - 72 = ST\n\nSubtract ST from both sides of each equation:\n\n1) -8S + 6T = 48\n2) 12S - 6T = 72\n\nNow we can solve the system of linear equations. Multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of T the same:\n\n1) -16S + 12T = 96\n\nNow add the two equations:\n\n1) -16S + 12T = 96\n2) +12S - 6T = 72\n-------------------\n      -4S + 6T = 168\n\nNow, subtract 6T from both sides:\n\n-4S = 168\n\nDivide both sides by -4:\n\nS = -42\n\nSince the speed cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem or the information given is inconsistent.

        "question": "The larger of two supplementary angles exceeds the smaller by 18 degrees. Find them.",
        "answer": 99,
        "generated": [
            "Answer: Let's assume the smaller angle is x degrees. Since the larger angle exceeds the smaller by 18 degrees, the larger angle is x + 18 degrees. Supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees, so we have x + (x + 18) = 180.\n\nCombining the terms, we get 2x + 18 = 180. Subtracting 18 from both sides, we get 2x = 162. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 81.\n\nSo, the smaller angle is 81 degrees, and the larger angle is 81 + 18 = 99 degrees.\nans = 81, 99",
            "Let the smaller angle be x degrees. Then the larger angle is (x + 18) degrees.

Since the perimeter of the rectangle is equal to the perimeter of the square, the perimeter of the rectangle is also 60 cm. \n\nLet the width of the rectangle be w cm. The perimeter of the rectangle is given by 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (18 + w) = 60 cm. \n\nSolving for w, we get:\n2 * (18 + w) = 60\n36 + 2w = 60\n2w = 24\nw = 12 cm\n\nNow that we have the width of the rectangle, we can find the area of the rectangle:\nArea = length * width = 18 * 12 = 216 square cm\nans = 216",

The perimeter of the rectangle is also 60 cm. Let the width be w cm. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width). So, 60 = 2 * (18 + w).\n\nSolving for w, we get 60 = 36 + 2w, which simplifies to 24 = 2w. Therefore, w = 12 cm.\n\nNow, we can find the area of the rectangle.

Since there are 9 Atomic Fireballs in a package, she bought 59/9 = 6.56 packages. Since she can't buy a fraction of a package, she must have bought 7 packages. \n\nSo, she bought 7 packages with 9 Atomic Fireballs each, which equals 7 * 9 = 63 Atomic Fireballs. \n\nNow, we subtract the number of Atomic Fireballs she ate: 63 - 59 = 4 Atomic Fireballs. \n\nans = 4",
