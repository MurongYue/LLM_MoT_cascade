There are 2 albums that hold 50 photos and 2 albums that hold 100 photos, making a total of 4 albums.\nNow, we need to find the number of albums that hold exactly 100 photos and are vertically oriented. From the table, there is only 1 album that meets this requirement.\nThe probability of selecting such an album is the number of desired outcomes (1) divided by the total number of outcomes (4). So, the probability is 1/4.\nAnswer: 1/4",
