        "answer": 8,
        "generated": [
            "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speed. Let the speed of the boat in still water be x km/h and the speed of the stream be y km/h.\n\nWhen the boat goes upstream, its effective speed is (x - y) km/h, and when it goes downstream, its effective speed is (x + y) km/h.\n\nFrom the given information, we can form two equations:\n\n1. (30 / (x - y)) + (44 / (x + y)) = 10\n2. (40 / (x - y)) + (55 / (x + y)) = 13\n\nNow, we can solve these two equations to find the values of x and y.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the equations:\n\n1. 30(x + y) + 44(x - y) = 10(x^2 - y^2)\n2. 40(x + y) + 55(x - y) = 13(x^2 - y^2)\n\nExpanding the equations:\n\n1. 30x + 30y + 44x - 44y = 10x^2 - 10y^2\n2. 40x + 40y + 55x - 55y = 13x^2 - 13y^2\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n1. 74x - 14y = 10x^2 - 10y^2\n2. 95x - 15y = 13x^2 - 13y^2\n\nNow, we can divide the first equation by 10 and the second equation by 13 to make it easier to solve:\n\n1. 7.4x - 1.4y = x^2 - y^2\n2. 7.3077x - 1.1538y = x^2 - y^2\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first equation:\n\n0.0923x - 0.2462y = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for x in terms of y or vice versa. Let's solve for x in terms of y:\n\nx = (0.2462y) / 0.0923 + 7.3077y\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x back into either equation 1 or 2. Let's use equation 1:\n\n7.4((0.2462y) / 0.0923 + 7.3077y) - 1.4y = (0.2462y) / 0.0923 + 7.3077y^2 - y^2\n\nSolving this equation for y, we get:\n\ny \u2248 2.2 km/h (speed of the stream)\n\nNow, substitute the value of y back into the expression for x:\n\nx \u2248 (0.2462 * 2.2) / 0.0923 + 7.3077 * 2.2\n\nx \u2248 17.8 km/h (speed of the boat in still water)\n\nSo, the speed of the stream is approximately 2.2 km/h, and the speed of the boat in still water is approximately 17.8 km/h."
