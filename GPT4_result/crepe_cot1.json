In the given context, the likelihood of putting contact lenses into the case is not directly addressed. If the context were reversed (i.e., taking off contact lenses and storing them), the likelihood of putting contact lenses into the case would be \"more likely\" after completing the necessary steps.\n\nAnswer: equally likely",
            "Explain: \nFor step 1, after washing your hands, the likelihood that you can put contact lenses into the case is \"equally likely\" because washing your hands does not affect putting contact lenses into the case.\nFor step 2, after removing the lid on one side of your contact lens case and setting it aside, the likelihood that you can put contact lenses into the case is \"more likely\" because you have opened the case and now have access to put the contact lenses in.\nFor step 3, after using your fingertip to slide the contact lens from the case, the likelihood that you can put contact lenses into the case is \"equally likely\" because this step is about removing the lens from the case, not putting it in.\n\nHowever, the provided context does not include the step of actually putting the contact lenses into the case. Based on the given context, the likelihood of being able to put contact lenses into the case is \"equally likely\" because none of the steps directly involve putting the lenses into the case.\n\nAnswer: equally likely",
