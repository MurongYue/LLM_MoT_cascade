There are different ways to approach this question, but one possible method is to first find the date one month ago from today (which is August 9, 1972), and then check if that date is a Tuesday. If it is, then the date of the appointments would be one day earlier (Monday, August 8, 1972). If it is not, then the date of the appointments would be the closest Tuesday before August 9, 1972 (which is August 1, 1972).
