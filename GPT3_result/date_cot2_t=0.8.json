            "Explain: If Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000, then her birthday is on Feb 29th. If today is her 16th birthday, then she was born on Feb 29, 2000, and today's date is Feb 29, 2016. However, since 2000 was a leap year and 1900 was not, there was no Feb 29th in 1900. Therefore, some computer systems and applications may handle this case differently. For the purpose of this exercise, we will assume that 2000 was a leap year and Feb 29, 2000, was a valid date. So the date today is 02/29/2016. \nA: 02/29/2016",

However, since we know that 176 days have passed since Jane quit her job, we need to count backwards 176 days from 20/09/2020 to get the date one year ago. So, 176 days before 20/09/2020 is 27/03/2020. Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 27/03/2019. \nA: 03/27/2019",
