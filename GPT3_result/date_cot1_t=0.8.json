            "Explain: Today's date is 8/3/1997. To determine the date 10 days ago, we subtract 10 from the day of the month: 3 - 10 = -7. However, we cannot have a negative day of the month, so we need to borrow a month and add the number of days in that month. July has 31 days, so we add 31 to -7: -7 + 31 = 24.

If we know the specific day of the week of Jane's appointment, we can count forward three days to find today's date. Otherwise, we can simply add three days to the given date.\n\nFor example, if we know that Jane's appointment is on a Monday, we can count forward three days (including Monday) to find today's date: Monday (appointment day), Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday (today's date). So the date today would be 04/10/1985.\n\nIf we don't know the day of the week of Jane's appointment, we can simply add three days to the given date of 04/10/1985 to find today's date: 04/10/1985 + 3 days = 04/13/1985.\n\nSo the answer could be either 04/10/1985 or 04/13/1985, depending on what information is given.",

            "Explain: Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017 and ate one per day. Today she ran out of eggs, so she has eaten 38 eggs in total (since May 9th is day 1 and today is day 38). \nTo find today's date, we need to add 38 days to May 9th, 2017.\nMay has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 31 days (31+30+31=92). So, we can subtract 92 from 38 to get a negative number (-54). This means we need to go back to April. \nApril has 30 days, so we subtract 30 from -54 to get -84. This means we need to go back to March.\nMarch has 31 days, so we subtract 31 from -84 to get -115. This means we need to go back to February.\nFebruary has 28 days (or 29 in a leap year), so we subtract 28 from -115 to get -143. This means we need to go back to January.\nJanuary has 31 days, so we subtract 31 from -143 to get -174. This means we need to go back to December of the previous year.\nDecember has 31 days, so we add 31 to -174 to get -143. \nTherefore, today's date is 12/21/2016.": 1,
